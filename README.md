## Data science case study of customer churn of a subscription service

This case study was conducted as part of an internship recruitment process. The prompt for the final case study was the following:

*Your client asks that you provide them with insights into the customer base and customer behaviors that can be used to increase revenue. You should use Python, SQL, or R to explore the data.*

The following files were given:

- *customer_data.csv*
- *subscription_prices.json*

The analysis was presented with the help of a slide deck (*churn_analysis_presentation.pdf*) during a successful final interview!
