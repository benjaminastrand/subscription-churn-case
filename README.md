# subscription-churn-case
## Data science case study of customer churn of a subscription service
**This case study was conducted as part of an internship recruitment process.**

**The prompt for the final case study was the following:**

*Your client asks that you provide them with insights into the customer base and customer behaviors that can be used to increase revenue. You should use Python, SQL, or R to explore the data.*

**The following files were given:**

- *customer_data.csv*
- *subscription_prices.json*

**The analysis was presented with the help of a slide deck (*churn_analysis_presentation.pdf*) during a successful final interview! You can find the code that I wrote in the notebook in this repository (*analysis.ipynb*).**

Below are some example slides, that I created for the final presentation, with a brief explanation for each one:
